🏏 # Elo Rating System for IPL Teams
This project implements a custom Elo rating system for Indian Premier League (IPL) teams, tailored to reflect the unique dynamics of cricket. It not only evaluates team performance across seasons but also predicts outcomes for future matches using machine learning models.

🔍 Features
📊 Elo Score Calculation: Assigns dynamic Elo ratings to IPL teams based on:

Win/Loss outcome

Match margin (runs or wickets)

Match context (league vs playoffs)

Home vs Away/Neutral advantage

📈 Year-wise and Cumulative Elo Ratings

🤖 Match Outcome Prediction using machine learning (XGBoost)

🧠 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering for IPL match records

📁 Includes visualizations of rating progression

 ⚙️ Elo Rating Logic
Initial Ratings: All teams start with a base rating (e.g., 1500).

Match Update:

Win/Loss outcome modifies ratings based on expected result.

Larger win margins give higher rating boosts.

Playoff matches have higher rating impact.

Home win gets lower gain than away/neutral win.

Decay and Carry-over: Elo ratings carry over to the next year.


📊 Model and Prediction
Uses XGBoost for match outcome prediction.

Features include:

Current Elo ratings

Margin of previous matches

Venue encoding (home/away/neutral)

Match stage (league or playoff)

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.8+

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost

tqdm

You can install the dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
