# üèè Elo Rating System for IPL Teams

This project introduces a sophisticated Elo rating system specifically designed for Indian Premier League (IPL) teams. It moves beyond simple win/loss records to provide a nuanced, dynamic measure of team strength and performance. By factoring in match context, margin of victory, and home-field advantage, the system offers deep insights into the competitive landscape of the IPL. Furthermore, it leverages this rating system to power a predictive machine learning model for forecasting future match outcomes.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Dynamic Elo Score Calculation**: Implements a custom Elo algorithm that assigns and updates team ratings based on:
    *   **Win/Loss Outcome**: The foundational element of rating changes.
    *   **Margin of Victory**: Larger wins (by runs or wickets) result in more significant rating gains.
    *   **Match Context**: Playoff matches have a greater impact on ratings compared to league stage matches.
    *   **Home vs. Away Advantage**: Acknowledges the challenge of winning on the road by rewarding away wins more generously.
*   **Historical Performance Tracking**: Analyzes and visualizes both year-wise and cumulative Elo ratings, allowing for a clear view of a team's performance trajectory over the seasons.
*   **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes an XGBoost classifier to predict match outcomes based on Elo ratings and other critical features.
*   **In-Depth Data Handling**: Features robust data cleaning and feature engineering pipelines for processing raw IPL match data.
*   **Rich Visualizations**: Generates intuitive graphs and charts to illustrate the progression of team ratings and model performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Elo Rating Logic

The core of this project is its custom-tailored Elo rating system. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1.  **Initial Ratings**: Every team begins with a baseline Elo rating of **1500**.
2.  **Match Updates**: After each match, ratings are updated based on a formula that considers the expected and actual outcomes. The adjustments are influenced by:
    *   The **pre-match rating difference** between the two teams.
    *   The **margin of victory**, with wider margins leading to larger rating shifts.
    *   The **stage of the competition**, with playoff matches carrying a higher weight.
    *   The **match venue**, where a home win yields a smaller rating gain than an away or neutral-venue victory.
3.  **Season-to-Season Carry-over**: A team's Elo rating at the end of a season is carried over to the start of the next, ensuring continuity and reflecting long-term form.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL-Elo-Rating-System.git
    cd IPL-Elo-Rating-System
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Launch the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Elo_rating_system_for_IPL_Teams.ipynb
    ```
2.  Run the cells in the notebook to see the entire pipeline in action, from data processing and Elo calculation to model training and evaluation.
3.  Feel free to modify the `data/matches.csv` file to include newer data and generate updated ratings and predictions.

## üìä Example Visualizations

Below are some examples of the visualizations generated by the notebook, showcasing team rating progressions and model performance.

## üß† Future Work

This project has a strong foundation, but there are several exciting avenues for future development:

*   **Player-Level Elo Ratings**: Extend the system to calculate and track Elo ratings for individual players.
*   **Real-Time Updates**: Integrate with a live sports data API to update ratings in real-time as matches conclude.
*   **Web Application**: Develop an interactive web dashboard using a framework like Streamlit or Flask to display ratings and prediction insights.
